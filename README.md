## Hi there 👋
I’m nearing the completion of my Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. I'm a junior full-stack developer and my goal is to build software that improve people's lives. How? By building sustainable solutions that makes societal, financial and environmental impact. What's the best part with information technology? That there's always something more that you can learn, more skills that you can acquire.
